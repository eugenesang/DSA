# Hash Map

 A hashmap is used to store key-value pairs.

## How It Works

- It uses a hash function to convert keys into valid array indices
- It then stores the key-value pair in the array at that index
- It uses a collision handling strategy to deal with collisions

## Implementation

- Hashmap has 2 main parts the `key` and the `value`
- The `key` is unique and points to where the value is stored
- The `value` is stored in the hashmap
